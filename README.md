Student Profile System

🧱 Step-by-Step Instructions

🔹 Step 1: Create a Class

Create a class named Student.

This class will store:

name

roll number

marks

🔹 Step 2: Initialize the Student

Use __init__() to:

accept name, roll number, and marks

store them inside the object

This runs automatically when the object is created.

🔹 Step 3: Create Methods

Add methods inside the class:

display_info()

→ Prints student details

check_

result()

→ Prints whether the student passed or failed

(You may decide pass marks, e.g. 40)

🔹 Step 4: Create an Object

Outside the class:

Take input from the user

Create one Student object

Example (conceptually):

“Create a student profile using the class”

🔹 Step 5: Call the Methods

Use the object to:

display student info

check result

This shows how objects use class methods.
